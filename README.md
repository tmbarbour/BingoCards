# Hallmark Movie Bingo
A single interactive HTML page to make watching a Hallmark Christmas, a little more fun with a friend.

It fills a Bingo card with the traditional Hallmark Movie formula elements.

When the page is loaded (or refreshed) it will create a new random bingo card. A you watch the movie and recognize a traditional Hallmark movie element, click on the square to change the color (be careful not to refresh the page during the movie). The pages can be printed if desired.
