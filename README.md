# Hallmark Movie Bingo
A single interactive HTML page to make watching a Hallmark Christmas movie a little more fun with a friend.

The web page creates a Bingo card with traditional Hallmark Movie formula elements.

When the page is loaded (or refreshed) it will build a new random bingo card. A you watch the movie and recognize a traditional Hallmark movie element, click on the square to change the color (be careful not to refresh the page during the movie). The pages can be printed if desired.
