# Bingo Card Generator
A single interactive HTML page to make watching something with a friend a little more enjoyable.

It fills a Bingo card with a entries from lists of 'Easy', 'Middle', and 'Hard' words. Depending on what difficulty level is chosen, the cards are filled mostly with Easy, a few Middle and token hard entries, plus a standard, 'free' middle square.

When the page is loaded (or refreshed) it will create a new random bingo card. As you watch or hear the commentators, click on the appropriate square. Can you get five in a row, either up down or diagonally before the end?

There are a couple of branches in the repository that you can try out:
* [Formula One Racing Bingo Card](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/tmbarbour/BingoCards/blob/FormulaOne/f1bingo.html) [F1 Github Branch](https://github.com/tmbarbour/BingoCards/tree/FormulaOne)
* [Hallmark Movie Bingo](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/tmbarbour/BingoCards/blob/hallmark-christmas/hallmarkChristmas.html). _(Click "Let's Play" to begin)_

>Note: This can easily be modified to be any kind of bingo. Simply change the *TITLE_OF_BINGO_PAGE* variable. Then customize the list of words in three categories *easy_word_list*, *mid_word_list* and *hard_word_list* in the script tag.
