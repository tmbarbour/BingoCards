# Racing Bingo
A single interactive HTML page to make watching racing, especially F1, a little more interesting than watching a parade.

It fills a Bingo card with commentary gems from Sky Racing's commentators, David Croft and Martin Brundle.

When the page is loaded (or refreshed) it will create a new random bingo card. As you hear the commentators mention the "Concertina effect" or the "Sterling effort" a driver is doing, click on the appropriate square. Can you get five in a row, either up down or diagonally before the end of the race? It can certianly make the race a little more interesting than watching one or two cars run out to a 30 second lead and lap half the field

>Note: This can easily be modified to be any kind of bingo. Simply change the *TITLE_OF_BINGO_PAGE* variable. Then customize the list of words in three categories *easy_word_list*, *mid_word_list* and *hard_word_list* in the script tag.
